The purpose of this bill is to control serious human rights abuses of the Government of Iran. The Iranian regime persecutes ethnic and religious minority groups, such as the Baha’is, Christians, Sufi, Sunni, and dissenting Shi’a Muslims (such as imprisoned Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi), through harassment, arrests, and imprisonment, during which detainees have routinely been beaten, tortured, and killed. Iran has violated the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other human right traties and international obligations.

This bill senses that Congress of the United States should deny the Government of Iran the ability to continue to oppress the people of Iran and to use violence and executions to silence pro-democracy protestors. Work with other countries to investigate the human rights violations committed by the Iran officials. It also requires the Unites States to support the people of Iran to establish basic freedom and build foundations for a freely elected, non-corrupt,and open democratic political system.

To achieve the above goals it requires the president to determine whether senior Iranian officials are responsible for human rights abuses and whether official Iranian businesses should be sanctioned for public corruption under existing law. It also imposes blocking of property and denial of visa sanctions to the United States for Iranian Officials and family members responsible for politically motivated detentions of U.S. citizens and residents, or abuses against Iranian expatriates.



##### This bill should be encouraged to voted for and passed into law because the Iranian regime continues to perpetuate so many innocent lives. They suppress the country's voice by censoring the media and continue their illegal and corrupt practices. In terms of American interest, they have 5 Americans currently held hostages. By enacting this bill, this unhuman and cruel regime will be put to an end by the United States and other countries.


##### Results of this bill:
##### The bill was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, Financial Services, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned. This bill was successfully passed with 410 yes, 2 no and 16 no votes on 26th April, 2018.
